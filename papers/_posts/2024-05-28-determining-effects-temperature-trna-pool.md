# Abstract 
The genetic code consists of 61 codons coding for 20 amino acids. These codons are recognized by transfer RNAs (tRNAs) that bind to specific codons during protein synthesis. All organisms utilize less than all 61 possible anticodons due to base pair wobble: the ability to have a mismatch with a codon at its third nucleotide. Previous studies observed a correlation between the tRNA pool of bacteria and the temperature of their respective environments. However, it is unclear if these patterns represent biological adaptations to maintain the efficiency and accuracy of protein synthesis in different environments. A mechanistic mathematical model of mRNA translation is used to quantify the expected elongation rates and error rate for each codon based on an organism's tRNA pool. A comparative analysis across a range of bacteria that accounts for covariance due to shared ancestry is performed to quantify the impact of environmental temperature on the evolution of the tRNA pool. We find that thermophiles generally have more anticodons represented in their tRNA pool than mesophiles or psychrophiles. Based on our model, this increased diversity is expected to lead to increased missense errors. The implications of this for protein evolution in thermophiles are discussed.

# Significance
Protein synthesis is a vital biological process; however, our understanding of the impact of environmental factors, such as temperature, on the evolution of the molecular mechanisms involved in protein synthesis is limited. In this study, we investigated the impact of environmental temperature on the evolution of the transfer RNA (tRNA) pool. Our analyses revealed that heat-loving bacteria (thermophiles) generally have more anticodons represented in their tRNA pool. Based on a simple model of ribosome elongation, this observed increase in tRNA diversity in thermophiles is expected to increase the frequency of translation errors. We speculate the increased diversity of the tRNA pool could be due to the decreased efficiency of wobble base pairing at higher temperatures, necessitating more tRNA with exact codonâ€“anticodon pairings. Our findings provide key insights into the role of the environment in shaping the tRNA pool.
