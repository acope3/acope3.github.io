# Abstract 

Rosenberg AA, Marx A, Bronstein AM (Codon-specific Ramachandran plots show amino acid backbone conformation depends on identity of the translated codon. Nat Commun. 2022:13:2815) recently found a surprising correlation between synonymous codon usage and the dihedral bond angles of the resulting amino acid. However, their analysis did not account for the strongest known correlate of codon usage: gene expression. We re-examined the relationship between bond angles and codon usage by applying the approach of Rosenberg et al. to simulated protein-coding sequences that (i) have random codon usage, (ii) codon usage determined by mutation biases, and (iii) maintain the general relationship between codon usage and gene expression via the assumption of selection-mutation-drift equilibrium. We observed correlations between dihedral bond angle and codon usage when codon usage is entirely random, indicating possible conflation of noise with differences in bond angle distributions between synonymous codons. More relevant to the general analysis of codon usage patterns, we found surprisingly good agreement between the analysis of the real sequences and the analysis of sequences simulated assuming selection-mutation-drift equilibrium, with 91% of significant synonymous codon pairs detected in the former were also detected in the latter. We believe the correlation between codon usage and dihedral bond angles resulted from the variation in codon usage across genes due to the interplay between mutation bias, natural selection for translation efficiency, and gene expression, further underscoring these factors must be controlled for when looking for novel patterns related to codon usage.

# Significance

Synonymous mutations—those that alter the DNA but not the amino acid sequence of a gene—are hypothesized to impact protein folding, with a recent paper finding differences in the protein bond angle distributions of an amino acid are dependent on the synonymous codon used to encode the amino acid in the DNA. We re-examined this relationship using simulated protein-coding sequences, finding evidence that the apparent relationship between codon usage and protein bond angles is confounded by the relationship between codon usage and gene expression. Our findings further emphasize the need to consider differences in gene expression when testing for possible relationships between a molecular feature or property and codon usage.
