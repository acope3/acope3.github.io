I have independently mentored many aspiring scientists from various backgrounds, resulting in multiple publications that include two senior author manuscripts (see C.V.).
My mentoring approach is highly individualized: I work with the trainee to determine their goals and the skills needed to achieve those goals.
Students I have trained have been very successful, with two of my trainees -- Vatsal Jain and Opetunde Akeju -- producing manuscripts from their projects.
