As a first-generation college student who attended Centre College - a teaching-focused liberal arts college in Danville, KY - I place great importance on excellent teaching.
As a CIRTL-certified teacher and as a recepient of the NIH-IRACDA INSPIRE postdoctoral fellowship, I am trained in scientific teaching.
I use evidence-based learning approaches, particularly active learning, that are known to improve student learning and retention.
I have applied these techniques working with both undergraduate and graduate students (see my C.V. for a list of courses).
When developing new courses and lectures, I take a backward design approach, beginning by defining my learning objectives and structuing the content and activities around meeting these objectives.
Based on my academic, research, and teaching experiences, I am qualified to teach courses that range in focus from evolutionary biology to bioinformatics.
